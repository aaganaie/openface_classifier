# openface_classifier

This is a simple openface program to create a classifier for 2 different classes of image . And use that classifier to predict class of test image we give 

In Creating_csv , I have run the program 2 times for creating 2 .csv file namely (Features0.csv ,Features.csv) . You can also just create a single .csv with both classess Features but you might need to do little changes in file  as per your needs .
